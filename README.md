+ Project summary: 
In this project, we compared two methods of author disambiguation, which are discussed in a pair of research papers written by [(a) Song, Yang, et al.](http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/papers/JCDL2007-topic_based_name_disambiguation.pdf) and [(b) Culotta, Aron, et al.](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/papers/culotta07author.pdf) from the Entity Resolution literature. 
In paper (a), we focused on the LDA methods. In paper (b), we adopted Clusterwise Score Function, and used Error-Driven Online Training to generate examples and Ranking MIRA as the loss function.
